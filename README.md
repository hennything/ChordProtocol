# ChordProtocol
A simple Python implementation of the Chord p2p protocol.

### Usage:
To launch a node one must pass it an ip address and port number as arguments

```
python node.py <ip> <port>
```

A node can join a chord ring by selecting 'join' in the menu prompt and passing it the ip address and the port number of a node in that node ring.
